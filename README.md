# parseHub
A directory test application for ParseHub

This project is a done in fulfillment of the job requirement by ParseHub 

There are two main directories, 

`1` Client
 
 `2` Server 
 
 To run the server you need to set up a port and this can be done by 
 
 Creating a `.env` file and then add `PORT=<Your desired port number>`
 
After the above step, open your terminal and run `npm install` and `npm start` on your terminal, this will start the server 
 
The client aspect was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## For the Client 

In the project directory, you should run:

### `npm install`

and then 

### `npm start`


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
