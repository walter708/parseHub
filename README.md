# parseHub

A directory test application for ParseHub

This project is done in fulfillment of the job requirement by ParseHub

There are two main directories,

`1` Client

`2` Server

To run the server you need to set up a port and this can be done by

Creating a `.env` file and then add `PORT=<Your desired port number>`

After the above step, open your terminal and run `npm start` on your terminal, this will start the server

The client aspect was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Then on your browser enter `<domain:3200>` this was tested with

`http://localhost:3200`

Alternatively you can run the Client and Server separately

To do this

To run the project clone the repository

On the root run `npm install`

and npm `npm start`

create a new terminal pointing to the project root directory

On this cd into the client

Run `npm install`

and then `npm start`
